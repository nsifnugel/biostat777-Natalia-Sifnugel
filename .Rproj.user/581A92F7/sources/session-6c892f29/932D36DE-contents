**Welcome!**

My name is Natalia and I am an MPH student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am from Boston, Massachusetts and have also lived in New Orleans and Madrid. For fun, I love to knit, watch the real housewives (any franchise), and travel. Below is a photo of me in Chefchaouen, Morocco.
