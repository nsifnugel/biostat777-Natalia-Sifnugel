## Background

I grew in Boston, Massachusetts and moved to New Orleans, LA in 2016 to attend Tulane University. There, I received a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. I also minored in chemistry and public health.

During college, I worked as an RA in the Fadok Laboratory at the Tulane Brain Institute, studying the biological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. After graduating, I took on a new RA position in the Sharpe Laboratory at Harvard Medical School where I investigated ways to leverage immune responses to fight cancer.

## Professional Goals

I am deeply passionate about the social determinants of health and closing gaps in health equity. After gaining my MPH, I am interested in using my data analysis skills in a consulting, nonprofit, or policy setting to advance the health of vulnerable populations in the US.

## Personal Facts

-   I have two older sisters.
-   I went to the oldest public high school in the US.
-   I love dachshunds and hope to someday rescue one!
