# biostat777-intro-Natalia-Sifnugel

Hey! My name is Natalia Sifnugel. I am an MPH student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This repository contains all files for my personal website, the first project for biostat777.

You can reach my website at: <https://nsifnugel.github.io/biostat777-intro-Natalia-Sifnugel/>

It was created using Quarto and deployed by rending to docs.
