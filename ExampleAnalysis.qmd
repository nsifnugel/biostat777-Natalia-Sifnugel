## Overview

As an example analysis, I used a data set published on the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repository. These data contain risk prediction scores for 14 different health outcomes for 100 simulated patients. The prediction scores are based on exposure to certain risk factors also included in the data set. The exposure(s) and outcome relationships were generated using logistic regression modeling of real world data.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%",fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("a.jpg")
```

With the patient risk prediction score data, the question I sought to answer was: are there sex differences in predicted risk and in risk factors? I also looked into the age distributions of each group as it could explain in part some of the observed differences.

The intended audience for this analysis is any health professional interested in observing the coherence of risk prediction models with existing literature and knowledge.

## Set Up

The code chunk below contains the libraries I used, how I read in the data set, and the preliminary data cleaning required for the sex stratified analysis.

```{r, output = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)

patient_risk_profiles <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-10-24/patient_risk_profiles.csv')

patient_data_wrangled <- patient_risk_profiles %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("age"), names_to = "age_cat", values_to = "Age_Y_N") %>%
  mutate(age_cat = factor(age_cat)) %>%
  filter(Age_Y_N == 1) %>%
  pivot_longer(c("Sex = FEMALE", "Sex = MALE"), names_to = "sex", values_to = "sex_Y_N") %>%
  filter(sex_Y_N == 1) %>% #some patients have duplicated sex data
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(which(duplicated(personId)), which(duplicated(personId)) - c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1))) %>% #removing patients marked as both male and female
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == "Sex = FEMALE" ~ "FEMALE",
    sex == "Sex = MALE" ~ "MALE"))

```

## Risk Prediction Score by Sex

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=12, fig.width=12}

  pivot_longer(-c(sex), names_to = "outcome", values_to = "predicted_risk") %>%
 # mutate(outcome = factor(outcome)) %>% 
  mutate(outcome = factor(outcome),
         outcome = str_remove_all(outcome,"predicted risk of "), 
         outcome = fct_recode(outcome,
